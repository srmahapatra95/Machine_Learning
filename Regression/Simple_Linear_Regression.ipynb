    "* Linear Regression is a simple statistical model, often used to model the relationshio between a dependent variable and one/more independent variables. If there is a significant relationship between them. It can be used to model, to some degree of accuracy, where a mechanistic model(like physical equations that predict the future states) does not exist and for the purpose of understanding, we need to discover an empirical model in its place that still has predicting capcbilites to an extent that is often acceptable.\n",
    "* It assumes a linear relationship between the features and target. Any deviations from linear behaviour between the feature and the target might impact the accuracy of the model by introducing bias, hence reducing the predictive power.\n",
    "* It is generally to be used where no existing mathematical or physics, or domain specific equations exist to predict the future state of the variable of interest, but if if we have a large dataset at our disposal then we can train this simple model to acquire the required parameters to efficiently describe the model."
